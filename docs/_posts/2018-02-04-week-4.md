Week 4 consisted of a lot of work using what I learned about how the diceware library parses command line arguments. I was able to figure out how to get the options I need in to the functions in diceware that handle input. I also spent some time writing more bdd specs and steps for testing. CircleCI isn't working perfectly just yet, but I am doing fine executing tests locally since there is no deployment step just yet.
