Week 3 involved spending a lot of time digging through the code of the primary dependency of this project--the diceware library found here on Github.

This is my first experience working heavily with a dependency that required more in-depth knowledge of the dependency code in order to provide the necessary abstraction to the user. This was also complicated by my lack of experience with Python packaging. I'm still learning.
