Week 5 involved working out ~~the~~ lots of technical details surrounding which AWS resources would be best suited to the task of running hashcat. Rather than opting for Elastic GPUs as originally planned, I chose EC2 g3.8xlarge. I did end up spending (read: wasting) time messing with Elastic GPUs;
however, I realized that they are incompatible with OpenCL--a hashcat requirement. I also had to request a resource limit increase from AWS Billing, which took away some valuable time.

GPU Optimized Instance Specifications:

Model | GPUs |	GPU Memory | vCPUs | Main Memory | EBS Bandwidth
------|------|-------------|-------|-------------|--------------
g3.4xlarge | 1 | 8 GiB | 16 | 122 GiB | 3.5 Gbps
g3.8xlarge | 2 | 16 GiB | 32 | 244 GiB | 7 Gbps
g3.16xlarge | 4 | 32 GiB | 64 | 488 GiB | 14 Gbps

I got the go ahead from AWS so I will be building the environment during week 6.
