I conducted my first run of tests with hashcat after some debugging of OpenCL/NVIDIA issues. I used two dictionary lists - one containing passwords from the rockyou hack and a very large dictionary from Offensive Security. This run took about 90 minutes using a combinator attack and some optimizations. I used the hash of the shortest vanilla diceware candidate that was generated. I couldn't solve the hash with the keyspace I provided. The results made me think of a few different optimizations that I could apply to this problem. A mask attack might allow me to leverage my knowledge of how diceware/balanced dicephrase construct passphrases and the characteristics that are applicable. I could also try using the diceware dictionary twice as inputs to the combinator since I know which dictionaries are used by default.
